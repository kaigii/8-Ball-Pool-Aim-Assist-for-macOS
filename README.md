**A computer vision-based aim assist tool designed for playing 8 Ball Pool on macOS. It uses real-time image analysis to detect white aiming lines in the game screen and draws extended, stable prediction paths to help players make more accurate shots.**

Through an intuitive GUI interface, you can adjust all image processing parameters in real-time to find the optimal settings for your screen.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-time Screen Analysis**: Captures specified game areas with millisecond-level processing
- **Advanced Image Processing**: Uses bilateral filtering, Canny edge detection, and other algorithms to precisely extract line features
- **Dual Hough Transform**: Detects both long and short line segments separately, improving detection rates at different viewing angles
- **Point Cloud Verification**: Uses RANSAC principles to verify and filter the most reliable line segments through edge point cloud support, eliminating noise interference
- **Smooth Line Tracking**: Exclusive LineTracker module eliminates line flickering and provides elegant fade-out effects
- **Non-intrusive Overlay Window**: Transparent overlay window built with PySide6 that can be superimposed on the game without affecting mouse events
- **Real-time Parameter Tuner**: Built-in powerful GUI parameter adjustment tool (tuner.py) for real-time fine-tuning of all visual processing parameters

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.9 or higher installed on your Mac.

### Installation

#### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kaigii/8-Ball-Pool-Aim-Assist-for-macOS.git
cd 8-Ball-Pool-Aim-Assist-for-macOS
```

#### 2. Install dependencies
It's recommended to install in a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üéÆ Usage

### 1. Project game screen to Mac
Use macOS's built-in "iPhone Screen Mirroring" feature or any other screen mirroring app to project your mobile game screen completely to your Mac desktop.

### 2. Set up pool table capture area
This is the most critical step! You need to manually specify the area for the program to analyze.

1. Press `Command + Shift + 4` on your Mac. The cursor will become a cross and display current coordinates.
2. Move the mouse to the top-left corner of the pool table area in the game window and note the x and y coordinates.
3. Drag the mouse to the bottom-right corner to calculate the **width** and **height** of the rectangle.
4. Open the `config.py` file in the project and modify the values in the `GAME_WINDOW_RECT` dictionary.

### 3. Run the main program
When everything is ready, execute in the terminal:
```bash
python3 main.py
```

The program will start a transparent overlay window and automatically open the parameter tuner. You should now see detected aiming lines on the game screen.

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration and Fine-tuning

The core configuration of this project is divided into two parts: `config.py` file for basic behavior and appearance settings, and the Tuner interface for fine-tuning image recognition accuracy.

### config.py File Settings
This file controls the core behavior and visual style of the auxiliary lines.

- **GAME_WINDOW_RECT**:
  - Purpose: Defines the screen capture area.
  - Adjustment: As described in "Usage", use Command+Shift+4 to measure and fill in the actual pixel coordinates and size of the pool table in the game.

- **HSV_WHITE_LOWER / HSV_WHITE_UPPER**:
  - Purpose: Defines the "white" range that the program should recognize. This is crucial for filtering out the game's auxiliary lines.
  - Adjustment: If line recognition is poor, you can fine-tune these values. Usually the range from `[0, 0, 200]` to `[180, 30, 255]` works for most situations.

- **USE_DUAL_HOUGH**:
  - Purpose: Switch line detection mode. True means using both long and short line segment detectors simultaneously, adapting to more situations; False uses only a single detector.
  - Adjustment: Keeping True usually works best.

- **LINE_ALPHA_DEFAULT**:
  - Purpose: Initial opacity (0-255) of newly detected auxiliary lines.
  - Adjustment: Higher values make lines more solid. 40 is a relatively soft initial value.

- **LINE_FADE_STEP**:
  - Purpose: Opacity reduction per frame when lines disappear.
  - Adjustment: Higher values make lines disappear faster. 8 provides a smooth fade-out effect.

- **LINE_WIDTH / LINE_COLOR**:
  - Purpose: Control the width (pixels) and color (RGB) of auxiliary lines.
  - Adjustment: Adjust according to personal preference.

- **ENABLE_TUNER**:
  - Purpose: Determines whether to automatically open the Tuner adjustment window when starting the main program.
  - Adjustment: When you find satisfactory parameters, you can set this to False for a cleaner execution.

### Tuner Real-time Parameter Adjustment
When running `main.py`, the Tuner window will automatically open, allowing you to adjust image processing parameters in real-time through sliders and immediately see results in the preview window. All your adjustments are automatically saved to the `params_ransac.json` file.

**Preview Window Goals:**
- **Left (Edge Detection)**: Ideally, this window should be completely black with only clear, clean white auxiliary lines remaining. Other desktop patterns (like the deer) should be completely filtered out.
- **Right (Detection Results)**: Green "point clouds" should be densely distributed on white auxiliary lines, and blue "Hough line segments" should perfectly coincide with auxiliary lines.

**Slider Functions:**
- **Bilateral Filter**: Image smoothing filter. Usually keep small values to remove slight image noise.
- **Canny Edge**: Key to edge detection.
  - **T1 and T2**: Control sensitivity. Adjust these two values until there's minimal noise and clearest lines in the left preview window.
- **min_inliers**: How many green point clouds a line needs to support to be considered valid. Appropriately increasing this value can filter out incorrect short lines.
- **Hough Long / Hough Short**: Control line segment detection algorithms.
  - **Threshold**: Detection threshold, higher values are more strict.
  - **MinLineLen**: Minimum accepted line segment length.
  - **MaxLineGap**: Maximum allowed gap between points on a line segment.
